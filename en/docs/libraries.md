The OpenHolidays API can be consumed directly via an HTTP call. However, if available, it is preferable to use a client library. 

The following libraries are available:

## JavaScript

- [Dlurak/open-holiday-js](https://github.com/Dlurak/open-holiday-js): A JavaScipt client for the OpenHolidays API.

## PHP

- [noahnxt/laravel-open-holiday-api](https://github.com/NoahNxT/laravel-open-holiday-api): A Laravel wrapper for the OpenHolidays API.
